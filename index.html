<div id="tab1">
<h1>Appearance</h1>
<b>Hair</b><br>
Long, thick, and naturally fairly straight. Despite being as soft a pink as rose petals in nature, it is as natural and healthy looking as it can be, suggesting a high tier bloodline.
<br>
<b>Eyes</b><br>
Doe-eyed and full of wide wonder, they're rather typical eyes for little girls her age in every way aside from color. A sign of her family's sins is obviously relevant in the strange mutation in her eye colors; something commonly referred to as "Heterochromia." Her right eye is blue while her left is green! Every member of the Rose family has some sort of hidden deformity, a mark of their detestable behavior, and Emily is the first to be so obvious.
<br>
<b>Facial</b><br>
While her head is ovular, her body still has a long way to grow, and thus is quite rounded. Her cheeks are full and soft, just barely visible freckles dotting across them over the bride of her nose. Her face has a very noticeable symmetrical quality, drawing attention to her family's quality, and adding to the contrast of her eyes.
<br>
<b>Complexion</b><br>
Mostly pure and smooth skin with a few typical blemishes like the aforementioned freckles and a couple tiny moles here and there, but very pale in nature. She is often mistaken for being sickly even when healthy, although her immune system is fairly weak and she is a rather meek individual herself.
<br>
<b>Body Type</b><br>
Thin and seemingly healthy for a girl her age when dressed up in clothing, but in reality her bones are starting to show through her skin--especially her ribs--indicating lack of nutrition and the beginning of malnourishment.
<br><br>
<h1>Personality</h1>
Emily is very timid and easily frightened. It's not so much that she's actually shy, more that she lives in a state of worry and stress thanks to her heritage and her family's lifestyle. Whether it is the wrath of the stranger or the disappointment of her mother doesn't matter, each will be treated with equal prejudice, causing the girl to distance herself from what she perceives as a possible threat and making gentle approaches and conversations all the more difficult. She is more comfortable with the approach of strangers if someone she feels she can trust is with her.

<div id="tab2">
<h1>History of the Rose Family</h1>
As common as most fairy-tales, the Rose family began with a pair of star-crossed-lovers. Society scoffed in disgust for various reasons, the most prominent being the prejudice mentality at the time against humans and magical creatures being anything less than hateful enemies. Being a newer clan of talented human mages among a large number of already old families, the lovers' descendants faced many trials and various hardships, but legend says it was their strong bond which gave them the ability to survive through it.
<br><br>
To this day, the Roses are seen as a highly influential British family, even regarded as high ranking New World politicians thanks to their involvement with many of man's trials and hardships. As the present became history, time erased the reality of magic and harnass-able energy from the minds of humans--or at least, the ones who didn't continue to practice it religiously behind closed doors. The strange pink haired family of wealth became increasingly secretive as the years passed, and now the only access the outside world has to their lives are small tidbits of information they allow to be leaked to the press. It is not uncommon to see a Rose attend things like charity events and various other "good will" spreading efforts. They are seen as a kindhearted people who will pay any cost to take care of their fellow man...
<br><br>
...Or at least, that is what they have led everyone to believe.
<br><br>
<h1>The Birth and Early Life of Emily</h1> 
Beatrice Rose was a beautiful young lady, full of so much potential, born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Her family treated her like a princess, believing for so long that she was some kind of gift from the gods that their mindset influenced such high snobby behavior from her they began to regret their decisions, and she was forced to resort to manipulating her surroundings in order to keep being as severely pampered. Naturally things that were out of her control, like the very pregnancy that began Emily's journey into existence, angered her. Not allowed to simply give up the baby by her family, she treated it with utter distaste and neglect, a constant reminder of her shattered dreams and unwanted intimate relations. The attitude of her family followed suit.
<br><br>
Emily grew up in a confusing mix of treatment that varied from mercy thanks to being "the family savior's child," all the way to violent audible and sometimes physical scoldings triggered by the smallest of things that were beyond the girl's control. When it was decided that her mother would attend an off-world establishment she was excited for the change of pace, but frightened by the unknown that awaited them. It was required of her mother to bring her along, much to her dismay of course, but Emily went willingly and rejoiced in her newfound freedom.

<div id="tab3">
<h1>The Family System</h1>
<b>Branches</b><br>
There are four prominent different groups within the Rose family, sharing the same last name but bearing different important skills and faction titles. Can you guess which one Emily belongs to?
<li>The Warriors:</li> The line that extends from the firstborn child of the two original lovers. They're considered the most prominent and powerful of the branches, and are inherently strong, allowing them to control the other factions through intimidation. Often hard headed with vile tempers, their skills stem from their physical and magical strength. The Warriors most commonly practice violently destructive magics.
<li>The Engineers:</li> Second in line, these techno-savvy nerds make up the engineering branch. While not very smart or capable in social settings, they have the mental capacity to invent phenomenal contraptions and are very good at studying foreign subjects. Typically considered the research department, their strongest skill lies within their hands-on capabilities. Tinkerers by nature, their magical attunements often fall under trees that offer high utility.
<li>The Tacticians:</li> Not so easily manipulated, and very good at pulling the strings behind the scenes--especially those of their hard headed Warrior counterparts--the Tacticians are not only the politicians, but also the poster children of the family. They are the ones seen attending public events, always very easy on the eyes, and capable of consistently producing gorgeous children. While they excell at manipulating situations, and completely controlling their own emotions and bodily functions, their magical talent is extremely lacking in comparison to their counterparts.
<li>The Seers:</li> The most obscure, hidden, and secretive of all the Rose branches, Seers are not inherently good looking or even all that smart. They age like fine wine, growing in usefulness as their life and magic progresses. They are the weakest of the four, their only skills being in their magical potential. Seers have the uncanny ability of being able to predict the future when they have gained enough experience in life and have become powerful entities. They primarily choose heavily sensory based magics.
<br><br>
<b>Hierarchy</b><br>
Each branch has its own "Leader," and how that leader is determined varies by branch. For the Warriors, the leader is the strongest and cruelest brute. Among the Engineers and Tacticians a leader is voted from a series of elected candidates, who are chosen based on popularity and ability to deliver on promises and various skills. For the Seers, whomever is the eldest living member is considered to be their representative. These four leaders are all part of a lesser council who meet with--and answer to--the Head of the Family. This so called "Head" is the monarch figure of the entire Rose clan, and they are chosen by a mix of all processes. Age is an important factor, as well as strength and popularity. Candidates are elected from various branches, and often battle to the death. Those who fail the trial don't deserve to live, let alone be called true Roses.
<br><br>
<h1>Cultural Laws & Regulations</h1>
<b>Respect</b><br>
The Head of the entire family is revered among their own like a god, only those they deem worthy are even allowed within their presence. While around the Head, the lesser Council members are required to be strictly respectful and humble, but they are known to take advantage of their titles around the rest of the clan. They often require a similar level of respect from their relatives, and are known to respond to disobedience with punishments of inhumane and cruel proportions.
<br><br>
<b>Patriarchy</b><br>
Males are strictly dominant over female members. The Roses possess a very old fashioned mindset, believing their men to be the ultimate warriors and providers for their women, who must always work hard to prove they are useful for more than just pumping out children. As terrible as it sounds, the women are generally fine with this treatment, mostly because it means they are pampered like princesses. No one holds high expectations for them, allowing them to be lazy and carefree while the men are pressured to keep providing the money required for their expensive lifestyles, as well as be the strongest and hardest working they actually can be. While a woman's value is in her body, a man's is in his work ethic.
<br><br>
<b>Allies</b><br>
While primarily connected to--and centralized in--the United Kingdom, the Roses have allies of their own both magical and completely human, that sometimes align with Britain's wishes and sometimes don't. The Roses are welcome guests in most of the New World thanks to their flashy and inaccurate portrayals of being a kindhearted and compassionate group of rich people. Despite being called good "friends," allies are still held at a strict distance and aren't even allowed to know about the different factions within the family, let alone that they work far differently than the general public assumes.
<br><br>
<b>"Romance"</b><br>
All marriages are arranged, and courtships must be signed off on by the parents of the future couples. In addition to this, the Roses have a strict system of inbreeding, they are not allowed to "dirty the bloodline" by creating children with lesser beings outside of their own clan, even if they are allies. Romance is a forced concept, siblings, cousins, and other various relatives are often forced into relationships for the sake of breeding and sometimes even political gain, and if they do not appear happy they are assumed to be ungrateful and are swiftly put to death. If any bastard or secret children with outsiders are discovered, the offender is required to end the lives of their own children by sacrificial rite. Most of the time this ends with the parents being framed for murdering their own offspring, stirring the public into an uproar and cruelly ruining their lives before they are put to death by an external government.

<h1>Items</h1>
<b>Small Backpack</b><br>
Filled with a couple of toys and coloring utensils, the backpack is everything Emily owns that counts as harmless child entertainment.
<br><br>
<b>Small Suitcase</b><br>
Packed tight with essentials such as clothing, hair care products and other various toiletries, etc. The wheeled case isn't intended to be used much for anything other than carting around her belongings.

<div id="tab1">
<b>Height:</b><br>3'4"<br>
<b>Weight:</b><br>35 lbs.<br><br>
<h1>Appearance</h1>
<b>Hair</b><br>
Long, thick, and naturally fairly straight. Despite being as soft a pink as rose petals in nature, it is as natural and healthy looking as it can be, suggesting a high tier bloodline.
<br>
<b>Eyes</b><br>
Doe-eyed and full of wide wonder, they're rather typical eyes for little girls her age in every way aside from color. A sign of her family's sins is obviously relevant in the strange mutation in her eye colors; something commonly referred to as "Heterochromia." Her right eye is blue while her left is green! Every member of the Rose family has some sort of hidden deformity, a mark of their detestable behavior, and Emily is the first to be so obvious.
<br>
<b>Facial</b><br>
While her head is ovular, her body still has a long way to grow, and thus is quite rounded. Her cheeks are full and soft, just barely visible freckles dotting across them over the bride of her nose. Her face has a very noticeable symmetrical quality, drawing attention to her family's quality, and adding to the contrast of her eyes.
<br>
<b>Complexion</b><br>
Mostly pure and smooth skin with a few typical blemishes like the aforementioned freckles and a couple tiny moles here and there, but very pale in nature. She is often mistaken for being sickly even when healthy, although her immune system is fairly weak and she is a rather meek individual herself.
<br>
<b>Body Type</b><br>
Thin and seemingly healthy for a girl her age when dressed up in clothing, but in reality her bones are starting to show through her skin--especially her ribs--indicating lack of nutrition and the beginning of malnourishment.
<br><br>
<h1>Personality</h1>
Emily is very timid and easily frightened. It's not so much that she's actually shy, more that she lives in a state of worry and stress thanks to her heritage and her family's lifestyle. Whether it is the wrath of the stranger or the disappointment of her mother doesn't matter, each will be treated with equal prejudice, causing the girl to distance herself from what she perceives as a possible threat and making gentle approaches and conversations all the more difficult. She is more comfortable with the approach of strangers if someone she feels she can trust is with her.

<div id="tab4">
As common as most fairy-tales, the Rose family began with a pair of star-crossed-lovers. Society scoffed in disgust for various reasons, the most prominent being the prejudice mentality at the time against humans and magical creatures being anything less than hateful enemies. Being a newer clan of talented human mages among a large number of already old families, the lovers' descendants faced many trials and various hardships, but legend says it was their strong bond which gave them the ability to survive through it.
<br><br>
To this day, the Roses are seen as a highly influential British family, even regarded as high ranking New World politicians thanks to their involvement with many of man's trials and hardships. As the present became history, time erased the reality of magic and harnass-able energy from the minds of humans--or at least, the ones who didn't continue to practice it religiously behind closed doors. The strange pink haired family of wealth became increasingly secretive as the years passed, and now the only access the outside world has to their lives are small tidbits of information they allow to be leaked to the press. It is not uncommon to see a Rose attend things like charity events and various other "good will" spreading efforts. They are seen as a kindhearted people who will pay any cost to take care of their fellow man...
<br><br>
...Or at least, that is what they have led everyone to believe.

<div id="tab7">
Beatrice Rose was a beautiful young lady, full of so much potential, born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Her family treated her like a princess, believing for so long that she was some kind of gift from the gods that their mindset influenced such high snobby behavior from her they began to regret their decisions, and she was forced to resort to manipulating her surroundings in order to keep being as severely pampered. Naturally things that were out of her control, like the very pregnancy that began Emily's journey into existence, angered her. Not allowed to simply give up the baby by her family, she treated it with utter distaste and neglect, a constant reminder of her shattered dreams and unwanted intimate relations. The attitude of her family followed suit.
<br><br>
Emily grew up in a confusing mix of treatment that varied from mercy thanks to being "the family savior's child," all the way to violent audible and sometimes physical scoldings triggered by the smallest of things that were beyond the girl's control. When it was decided that her mother would attend an off-world establishment she was excited for the change of pace, but frightened by the unknown that awaited them. It was required of her mother to bring her along, much to her dismay of course, but Emily went willingly and rejoiced in her newfound freedom.

</div>

<div id="tab10">
<b>Branches</b><br>
There are four prominent different groups within the Rose family, sharing the same last name but bearing different important skills and faction titles. Can you guess which one Emily belongs to?
<li>The Warriors:</li> The line that extends from the firstborn child of the two original lovers. They're considered the most prominent and powerful of the branches, and are inherently strong, allowing them to control the other factions through intimidation. Often hard headed with vile tempers, their skills stem from their physical and magical strength. The Warriors most commonly practice violently destructive magics.
<li>The Engineers:</li> Second in line, these techno-savvy nerds make up the engineering branch. While not very smart or capable in social settings, they have the mental capacity to invent phenomenal contraptions and are very good at studying foreign subjects. Typically considered the research department, their strongest skill lies within their hands-on capabilities. Tinkerers by nature, their magical attunements often fall under trees that offer high utility.
<li>The Tacticians:</li> Not so easily manipulated, and very good at pulling the strings behind the scenes--especially those of their hard headed Warrior counterparts--the Tacticians are not only the politicians, but also the poster children of the family. They are the ones seen attending public events, always very easy on the eyes, and capable of consistently producing gorgeous children. While they excell at manipulating situations, and completely controlling their own emotions and bodily functions, their magical talent is extremely lacking in comparison to their counterparts.
<li>The Seers:</li> The most obscure, hidden, and secretive of all the Rose branches, Seers are not inherently good looking or even all that smart. They age like fine wine, growing in usefulness as their life and magic progresses. They are the weakest of the four, their only skills being in their magical potential. Seers have the uncanny ability of being able to predict the future when they have gained enough experience in life and have become powerful entities. They primarily choose heavily sensory based magics.
<br><br>
<b>Hierarchy</b><br>
Each branch has its own "Leader," and how that leader is determined varies by branch. For the Warriors, the leader is the strongest and cruelest brute. Among the Engineers and Tacticians a leader is voted from a series of elected candidates, who are chosen based on popularity and ability to deliver on promises and various skills. For the Seers, whomever is the eldest living member is considered to be their representative. These four leaders are all part of a lesser council who meet with--and answer to--the Head of the Family. This so called "Head" is the monarch figure of the entire Rose clan, and they are chosen by a mix of all processes. Age is an important factor, as well as strength and popularity. Candidates are elected from various branches, and often battle to the death. Those who fail the trial don't deserve to live, let alone be called true Roses.
<br><br>
<h1>Cultural Laws & Regulations</h1>
<b>Respect</b><br>
The Head of the entire family is revered among their own like a god, only those they deem worthy are even allowed within their presence. While around the Head, the lesser Council members are required to be strictly respectful and humble, but they are known to take advantage of their titles around the rest of the clan. They often require a similar level of respect from their relatives, and are known to respond to disobedience with punishments of inhumane and cruel proportions.
<br><br>
<b>Patriarchy</b><br>
Males are strictly dominant over female members. The Roses possess a very old fashioned mindset, believing their men to be the ultimate warriors and providers for their women, who must always work hard to prove they are useful for more than just pumping out children. As terrible as it sounds, the women are generally fine with this treatment, mostly because it means they are pampered like princesses. No one holds high expectations for them, allowing them to be lazy and carefree while the men are pressured to keep providing the money required for their expensive lifestyles, as well as be the strongest and hardest working they actually can be. While a woman's value is in her body, a man's is in his work ethic.
<br><br>
<b>Allies</b><br>
While primarily connected to--and centralized in--the United Kingdom, the Roses have allies of their own both magical and completely human, that sometimes align with Britain's wishes and sometimes don't. The Roses are welcome guests in most of the New World thanks to their flashy and inaccurate portrayals of being a kindhearted and compassionate group of rich people. Despite being called good "friends," allies are still held at a strict distance and aren't even allowed to know about the different factions within the family, let alone that they work far differently than the general public assumes.
<br><br>
<b>"Romance"</b><br>
All marriages are arranged, and courtships must be signed off on by the parents of the future couples. In addition to this, the Roses have a strict system of inbreeding, they are not allowed to "dirty the bloodline" by creating children with lesser beings outside of their own clan, even if they are allies. Romance is a forced concept, siblings, cousins, and other various relatives are often forced into relationships for the sake of breeding and sometimes even political gain, and if they do not appear happy they are assumed to be ungrateful and are swiftly put to death. If any bastard or secret children with outsiders are discovered, the offender is required to end the lives of their own children by sacrificial rite. Most of the time this ends with the parents being framed for murdering their own offspring, stirring the public into an uproar and cruelly ruining their lives before they are put to death by an external government.

<b>Small Backpack</b><br>
Filled with a couple of toys and coloring utensils, the backpack is everything Emily owns that counts as harmless child entertainment.
<br><br>
<b>Small Suitcase</b><br>
Packed tight with essentials such as clothing, hair care products and other various toiletries, etc. The wheeled case isn't intended to be used much for anything other than carting around her belongings.

<p align="center"><i>"The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level. (Most spells taught in class are under this tree. Spells taught in class must be on your character sheet, and any alterations or upgrades to taught spells must be discussed with a professor.)"</i></p>
<br>
<b>Aura</b><br>
Every living thing has mana, and the colors of their mana and their aura vary from person to person. Emily's manifests most commonly in varying shades of pink, but can also take on green and purple hues.
<br>
<i>"Pink is a delicate color that means sweet, nice, playful, cute, romantic, charming, feminine, and tenderness. It is associated with bubble gum, flowers, babies, little girls, cotton candy, and sweetness. The color pink is the color of universal love of oneself and of others."</i>
<br><br>
<b>Mana Weave</b><br>
To weave ones mana is the very essence of being a mage; almost every spell that you will learn from this tome, as well as spells you develop of your own volition will incorporate this technique in some way, shape, or form. Weaving mana is an extremely simple task to those who are born with an active mana pool; simply focus on a singular part of the body -- typically the hands --  and envision a manifestation of your inner energies bubbling to it's surface.
<br>
​There are numerous books in the Grand Archives that take this process into more depth, and this overview is meant to act as a reference rather than a teacher, so if this is your first time attempting the magical arts, the best course of action for you would be to consult another mage for help, or at the very least another book for beginners within the library.
<br>
​This is a general spell, and has no single specific teacher. 
<br><br>
<b>Mana Spark</b><br>
The next practical step for a mage who has learned to weave their mana is to learn to produce a mana spark. A mana spark is a relatively harmless projection of a mage's energies, creating a physical form and direction to one's mana without actually imbuing heavily violent intent upon it. It is the easiest way to learn the basics of creating projectiles via one's magic, and the physical techniques hind the theory are often reproduced to create a range of different attacks.
<br>
To create a mana spark, one must weave mana into a part of their body (or a medium) and quickly push the energies forward, out of the object it is weaving inside and into the physical world. This is generally done via a flick of the wrist when weaving through a hand, or a swish of a wand et cetera for a medium. Once the technique of forcing the energy out has been learned, it is only a matter of practice and muscle memory to become proficient with its directional accuracy and speed. Do not fear testing these out with partners, as being hit on the bare flesh with a mana spark feels much like a harsh pinch at best.

This is a general spell, and has no single specific teacher.

Universal Spells (Mana Manipulation)
</div>

<div id="tab18">
<p align="center"><i>"The epitome of mana manipulation. Those that take this tree end up taking their skills in this art to levels so ridiculous they can solidify their mana into all shapes and sizes. Manatists start off with an advanced form of mana manipulation that makes them just a bit more adept at Paige rank with their skill than others. This of course doesn't stop being a fact as they rank up and as they learn spells, but lose their edge as their peers get more experienced. With their inate ability at mana manipulation, they are able to learn universal spells that are meant for those a rank above them and below.  Without a question of a doubt, their trump card comes in the form of an advanced form of mana, the purest a mage could possibly make. Arcane energy is a very volatile and destructive force, one that takes much time to master but is fully worth the journey from Expert Mage to the upper ranks available to mages. Some even say its power cannot be matched at its zenith."</i></p>

<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Mana Bubble</b><br>
A thin shiny construct that has the appearance of liquid but is actually just a slippery solid. It takes the shape of a sphere, designed to form around objects, and can even float on the air like a typical bubble when occupied by an object of equal durability to itself (Lead at Paige as a defensive construct, scaling naturally to Steel at Mage), but that also means it’s easy to blow away from the caster. Should the bubble ever reach more than five feet away from its maker (distance increasing naturally to scale through the ranks, capping at ten feet upon reaching Mage)  it’ll harmlessly pop into nothingness. Typically this construct has to be able to completely encompass an object for it to work as intended (although nothing is REQUIRED to be inside it for activation and function, although removal of something present from the inside will result in its destruction/deactivation) and since it can only be either as big as a baseball, or a basketball if charged for a rotation prior to casting, the options are pretty limited. The only exception to this is the caster’s own body parts, since it’s not near big enough to encompass her entire being she can form it to “engulf” hands, feet, etc with the rest of herself sticking out. It loses its ability to float when formed on her person, but retains its defensive qualities and durability. That being said the oxygen inside is naturally limited, allowing for the possibility of suffocation if used on her head for extended periods of time.
<br>
Upon reaching the rank of Mage she will automatically be able to make up to two bubbles at a time.
<br><br>
<b>Magus Rose</b><br>
This construct is seemingly quite innocent, appearing as nothing more than a rather fragile rose, like the glass ones rich people buy from Hallmark shops for some reason. Its stem is no thicker than a pencil, the rose bulb at its end roughly two inches thick, and altogether it’s no longer than one whole foot. The construct in its entirety is only tin in durability (scaling naturally through the ranks and capping with Iron at Mage) and seemingly has no real use despite looking pretty. Should it get further than five feet from its caster, or be in physical contact with a mage that isn’t its creator, then the construct will destabilize and spontaneously crumble into small sharp shards and pieces, dissipating entirely from existence in the next rotation. These shards can’t do much damage at first, other than scratching at bare skin about as roughly as fingernails clawing at an itch, but as its durability increases so does its capacity for damage (possible “piercing” power increases, equaling the construct’s durability). Emily can only have one of these roses active at a time, automatically unlocking the ability to make up to two at a time upon reaching Mage rank.
<br><br>
<b>Sparkles the Unicorn</b><br>
A fantastical groundbreaking creation, behold the hobby-horse construct! Sparkles the Unicorn is a pink horned horse-head on a long staff, made entirely out of the caster’s solidified mana. In its entirety the construct is only as durable as tin, with the six inch horn sticking out from the center of its forehead possessing the same capacity for piercing power (scaling up to Iron at Mage rank). Sparkles’ staff is about four feet long, and fits comfortably between its owner’s legs. As unassuming as the toy construct seems it’s actually a decent mode of transportation, capable of holding its caster’s weight and gliding at a steady slow pace  from up to three feet above the ground for one rotation. This aspect scales with the caster’s rank adding an additional rotation to the length of the glide (and therefore slowing its “falling speed”) until she reaches the rank of Mage, when she may indefinitely hover at the cost of a constant mana drain. At the moment it can only zoom around at the calm speed of the average human’s jog, but hey, what other six year old girl can say she has a functioning "witch’s broom" for a unicorn themed hobby horse?

<p align="center"><i>"The Pagans are mages who wield the destructive forces of nature. A Pagan may begin with simple abilities, such as talking to animals, making plants grow, or making small rain clouds. However, as these mages practice and hone their craft, powerful storms will accumulate at their command, and charging beasts will follow their every word. Such mages even possess the ability to cultivate and assault others with deadly diseases and viruses, and can create natural disasters after attaining highly skilled control with their magic."</i></p>

Forcient is divided into three different branches, each of which controls a small array of forces. A Kinetics mage focuses primarily on the forces of movement; the manipulation of kinetic and potential energy are their specialty. However, many mages may find they have gained access to the manipulation of pressure, and other forces outside of gravity and magnetism. A Kinetics mage's magic is very special- while it is magic, their spells often inflict physical damage."</i></p>

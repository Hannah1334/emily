<div id="tab1">
<b>Height:</b><br>3'4"<br>
<b>Weight:</b><br>35 lbs.<br><br>
<h1>Appearance</h1>
<b>Hair</b><br>
Long, thick, and naturally fairly straight. Despite being as soft a pink as rose petals in nature, it is as natural and healthy looking as it can be, suggesting a high tier bloodline.
<br>
<b>Eyes</b><br>
Doe-eyed and full of wide wonder, they're rather typical eyes for little girls her age in every way aside from color. A sign of her family's sins is obviously relevant in the strange mutation in her eye colors; something commonly referred to as "Heterochromia." Her right eye is blue while her left is green! Every member of the Rose family has some sort of hidden deformity, a mark of their detestable behavior, and Emily is the first to be so obvious.
<br>
<b>Facial</b><br>
While her head is ovular, her body still has a long way to grow, and thus is quite rounded. Her cheeks are full and soft, just barely visible freckles dotting across them over the bride of her nose. Her face has a very noticeable symmetrical quality, drawing attention to her family's quality, and adding to the contrast of her eyes.
<br>
<b>Complexion</b><br>
Mostly pure and smooth skin with a few typical blemishes like the aforementioned freckles and a couple tiny moles here and there, but very pale in nature. She is often mistaken for being sickly even when healthy, although her immune system is fairly weak and she is a rather meek individual herself.
<br>
<b>Body Type</b><br>
Thin and seemingly healthy for a girl her age when dressed up in clothing, but in reality her bones are starting to show through her skin--especially her ribs--indicating lack of nutrition and the beginning of malnourishment.
<br><br>
<h1>Personality</h1>
Emily is very timid and easily frightened. It's not so much that she's actually shy, more that she lives in a state of worry and stress thanks to her heritage and her family's lifestyle. Whether it is the wrath of the stranger or the disappointment of her mother doesn't matter, each will be treated with equal prejudice, causing the girl to distance herself from what she perceives as a possible threat and making gentle approaches and conversations all the more difficult. She is more comfortable with the approach of strangers if someone she feels she can trust is with her.

<div id="tab4">
As common as most fairy-tales, the Rose family began with a pair of star-crossed-lovers. Society scoffed in disgust for various reasons, the most prominent being the prejudice mentality at the time against humans and magical creatures being anything less than hateful enemies. Being a newer clan of talented human mages among a large number of already old families, the lovers' descendants faced many trials and various hardships, but legend says it was their strong bond which gave them the ability to survive through it.
<br><br>
To this day, the Roses are seen as a highly influential British family, even regarded as high ranking New World politicians thanks to their involvement with many of man's trials and hardships. As the present became history, time erased the reality of magic and harnass-able energy from the minds of humans--or at least, the ones who didn't continue to practice it religiously behind closed doors. The strange pink haired family of wealth became increasingly secretive as the years passed, and now the only access the outside world has to their lives are small tidbits of information they allow to be leaked to the press. It is not uncommon to see a Rose attend things like charity events and various other "good will" spreading efforts. They are seen as a kindhearted people who will pay any cost to take care of their fellow man...
<br><br>
...Or at least, that is what they have led everyone to believe.

<div id="tab7">
Beatrice Rose was a beautiful young lady, full of so much potential, born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Her family treated her like a princess, believing for so long that she was some kind of gift from the gods that their mindset influenced such high snobby behavior from her they began to regret their decisions, and she was forced to resort to manipulating her surroundings in order to keep being as severely pampered. Naturally things that were out of her control, like the very pregnancy that began Emily's journey into existence, angered her. Not allowed to simply give up the baby by her family, she treated it with utter distaste and neglect, a constant reminder of her shattered dreams and unwanted intimate relations. The attitude of her family followed suit.
<br><br>
Emily grew up in a confusing mix of treatment that varied from mercy thanks to being "the family savior's child," all the way to violent audible and sometimes physical scoldings triggered by the smallest of things that were beyond the girl's control. When it was decided that her mother would attend an off-world establishment she was excited for the change of pace, but frightened by the unknown that awaited them. It was required of her mother to bring her along, much to her dismay of course, but Emily went willingly and rejoiced in her newfound freedom.

</div>

<div id="tab10">
<b>Branches</b><br>
There are four prominent different groups within the Rose family, sharing the same last name but bearing different important skills and faction titles. Can you guess which one Emily belongs to?
<li>The Warriors:</li> The line that extends from the firstborn child of the two original lovers. They're considered the most prominent and powerful of the branches, and are inherently strong, allowing them to control the other factions through intimidation. Often hard headed with vile tempers, their skills stem from their physical and magical strength. The Warriors most commonly practice violently destructive magics.
<li>The Engineers:</li> Second in line, these techno-savvy nerds make up the engineering branch. While not very smart or capable in social settings, they have the mental capacity to invent phenomenal contraptions and are very good at studying foreign subjects. Typically considered the research department, their strongest skill lies within their hands-on capabilities. Tinkerers by nature, their magical attunements often fall under trees that offer high utility.
<li>The Tacticians:</li> Not so easily manipulated, and very good at pulling the strings behind the scenes--especially those of their hard headed Warrior counterparts--the Tacticians are not only the politicians, but also the poster children of the family. They are the ones seen attending public events, always very easy on the eyes, and capable of consistently producing gorgeous children. While they excell at manipulating situations, and completely controlling their own emotions and bodily functions, their magical talent is extremely lacking in comparison to their counterparts.
<li>The Seers:</li> The most obscure, hidden, and secretive of all the Rose branches, Seers are not inherently good looking or even all that smart. They age like fine wine, growing in usefulness as their life and magic progresses. They are the weakest of the four, their only skills being in their magical potential. Seers have the uncanny ability of being able to predict the future when they have gained enough experience in life and have become powerful entities. They primarily choose heavily sensory based magics.
<br><br>
<b>Hierarchy</b><br>
Each branch has its own "Leader," and how that leader is determined varies by branch. For the Warriors, the leader is the strongest and cruelest brute. Among the Engineers and Tacticians a leader is voted from a series of elected candidates, who are chosen based on popularity and ability to deliver on promises and various skills. For the Seers, whomever is the eldest living member is considered to be their representative. These four leaders are all part of a lesser council who meet with--and answer to--the Head of the Family. This so called "Head" is the monarch figure of the entire Rose clan, and they are chosen by a mix of all processes. Age is an important factor, as well as strength and popularity. Candidates are elected from various branches, and often battle to the death. Those who fail the trial don't deserve to live, let alone be called true Roses.
<br><br>
<h1>Cultural Laws & Regulations</h1>
<b>Respect</b><br>
The Head of the entire family is revered among their own like a god, only those they deem worthy are even allowed within their presence. While around the Head, the lesser Council members are required to be strictly respectful and humble, but they are known to take advantage of their titles around the rest of the clan. They often require a similar level of respect from their relatives, and are known to respond to disobedience with punishments of inhumane and cruel proportions.
<br><br>
<b>Patriarchy</b><br>
Males are strictly dominant over female members. The Roses possess a very old fashioned mindset, believing their men to be the ultimate warriors and providers for their women, who must always work hard to prove they are useful for more than just pumping out children. As terrible as it sounds, the women are generally fine with this treatment, mostly because it means they are pampered like princesses. No one holds high expectations for them, allowing them to be lazy and carefree while the men are pressured to keep providing the money required for their expensive lifestyles, as well as be the strongest and hardest working they actually can be. While a woman's value is in her body, a man's is in his work ethic.
<br><br>
<b>Allies</b><br>
While primarily connected to--and centralized in--the United Kingdom, the Roses have allies of their own both magical and completely human, that sometimes align with Britain's wishes and sometimes don't. The Roses are welcome guests in most of the New World thanks to their flashy and inaccurate portrayals of being a kindhearted and compassionate group of rich people. Despite being called good "friends," allies are still held at a strict distance and aren't even allowed to know about the different factions within the family, let alone that they work far differently than the general public assumes.
<br><br>
<b>"Romance"</b><br>
All marriages are arranged, and courtships must be signed off on by the parents of the future couples. In addition to this, the Roses have a strict system of inbreeding, they are not allowed to "dirty the bloodline" by creating children with lesser beings outside of their own clan, even if they are allies. Romance is a forced concept, siblings, cousins, and other various relatives are often forced into relationships for the sake of breeding and sometimes even political gain, and if they do not appear happy they are assumed to be ungrateful and are swiftly put to death. If any bastard or secret children with outsiders are discovered, the offender is required to end the lives of their own children by sacrificial rite. Most of the time this ends with the parents being framed for murdering their own offspring, stirring the public into an uproar and cruelly ruining their lives before they are put to death by an external government.

<div id="tab13">
<b>Small Backpack</b><br>
Filled with a couple of toys and coloring utensils, the backpack is everything Emily owns that counts as harmless child entertainment.
<br><br>
<b>Small Suitcase</b><br>
Packed tight with essentials such as clothing, hair care products and other various toiletries, etc. The wheeled case isn't intended to be used much for anything other than carting around her belongings.
<br><br>
<h1>High Mage Medium</h1>
<b>Unicorn’s Charm</b>
A small silver charm in the shape of a unicorn head with fancy pink diamonds embedded into its surface (Titanium durability in its entirety), deigned to fit on any average accessory chain or piece of jewelry (like necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc). When first imbuing it with her magic and turning it into a High Mage Medium, Emily thought fondly of Sparkles the Unicorn, making that specific construct the primary focus. As a result a special version of that specific spell was made through the Medium (special Medium version only accessible when using the Medium to cast it, base Sparkles the Unicorn Spell by itself remains the same as the version pitched at Expert Mage). It can be created and have its abilities utilized for a reduced cost to the mana pool whilst increasing its movement speed when flying to x4 (cannot have movement speed buffed any further when in flight) and increasing the distance it can fly above ground to 30 feet (instead of 20 which is what the base version has). It is still required to be within 30 feet of Emily to continue existing, and now when it’s within that vicinity she can also use it as a catalyst to cast Manatism spells through without physical contact. Distance limitations for other Manatism spells still apply. This version of Sparkles the Unicorn may passively exist and move about on the ground at no extra mana cost, almost as if it were a toy or puppet, but utilizing its abilities and manipulating it with the intention of battling (being aggressive) will bring back its consistent mana drain.
<br>
She can also use the charm to cast Paganism spells through for a reduced mana cost. Doing so allows Paganism spells with limited rotation durations to have one additional post time added to their total possible rotations of activity. Spells that have distance limitations (in reference to how far away spells can exist from the caster) gain an additional possible 10 foot boost.

Every living thing has mana, and the colors of their mana and their aura vary from person to person. Emily's manifests most commonly in varying shades of pink, but can also take on green and purple hues.
<br>
<i>"Pink is a delicate color that means sweet, nice, playful, cute, romantic, charming, feminine, and tenderness. It is associated with bubble gum, flowers, babies, little girls, cotton candy, and sweetness. The color pink is the color of universal love of oneself and of others."</i>

<b>Mana Weave</b><br>
To weave ones mana is the very essence of being a mage; almost every spell that you will learn from this tome, as well as spells you develop of your own volition will incorporate this technique in some way, shape, or form. Weaving mana is an extremely simple task to those who are born with an active mana pool; simply focus on a singular part of the body -- typically the hands --  and envision a manifestation of your inner energies bubbling to it's surface.
<br>
​There are numerous books in the Grand Archives that take this process into more depth, and this overview is meant to act as a reference rather than a teacher, so if this is your first time attempting the magical arts, the best course of action for you would be to consult another mage for help, or at the very least another book for beginners within the library.
<br>
​This is a general spell, and has no single specific teacher. 
<br><br>
<b>Mana Spark</b><br>
The next practical step for a mage who has learned to weave their mana is to learn to produce a mana spark. A mana spark is a relatively harmless projection of a mage's energies, creating a physical form and direction to one's mana without actually imbuing heavily violent intent upon it. It is the easiest way to learn the basics of creating projectiles via one's magic, and the physical techniques hind the theory are often reproduced to create a range of different attacks.
<br>
To create a mana spark, one must weave mana into a part of their body (or a medium) and quickly push the energies forward, out of the object it is weaving inside and into the physical world. This is generally done via a flick of the wrist when weaving through a hand, or a swish of a wand et cetera for a medium. Once the technique of forcing the energy out has been learned, it is only a matter of practice and muscle memory to become proficient with its directional accuracy and speed. Do not fear testing these out with partners, as being hit on the bare flesh with a mana spark feels much like a harsh pinch at best.

Universal Spells (Mana Manipulation)
</div>

<div id="tab18">
<p align="center"><i>"The epitome of mana manipulation. Those that take this tree end up taking their skills in this art to levels so ridiculous they can solidify their mana into all shapes and sizes. Manatists start off with an advanced form of mana manipulation that makes them just a bit more adept at Paige rank with their skill than others. This of course doesn't stop being a fact as they rank up and as they learn spells, but lose their edge as their peers get more experienced. With their inate ability at mana manipulation, they are able to learn universal spells that are meant for those a rank above them and below.  Without a question of a doubt, their trump card comes in the form of an advanced form of mana, the purest a mage could possibly make. Arcane energy is a very volatile and destructive force, one that takes much time to master but is fully worth the journey from Expert Mage to the upper ranks available to mages. Some even say its power cannot be matched at its zenith."</i></p>

<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Mana Bubble</b><br>
A thin shiny construct that has the appearance of liquid but is actually just a slippery solid. It takes the shape of a sphere, designed to form around objects, and can even float on the air like a typical bubble when occupied by an object of equal durability to itself (Lead at Paige as a defensive construct, scaling naturally to Steel at Mage), but that also means it’s easy to blow away from the caster. Should the bubble ever reach more than five feet away from its maker (distance increasing naturally to scale through the ranks, capping at ten feet upon reaching Mage)  it’ll harmlessly pop into nothingness. Typically this construct has to be able to completely encompass an object for it to work as intended (although nothing is REQUIRED to be inside it for activation and function, although removal of something present from the inside will result in its destruction/deactivation) and since it can only be either as big as a baseball, or a basketball if charged for a rotation prior to casting, the options are pretty limited. The only exception to this is the caster’s own body parts, since it’s not near big enough to encompass her entire being she can form it to “engulf” hands, feet, etc with the rest of herself sticking out. It loses its ability to float when formed on her person, but retains its defensive qualities and durability. That being said the oxygen inside is naturally limited, allowing for the possibility of suffocation if used on her head for extended periods of time.
<br>
Upon reaching the rank of Mage she will automatically be able to make up to two bubbles at a time.
<br><br>
<b>Magus Rose</b><br>
This construct is seemingly quite innocent, appearing as nothing more than a rather fragile rose, like the glass ones rich people buy from Hallmark shops for some reason. Its stem is no thicker than a pencil, the rose bulb at its end roughly two inches thick, and altogether it’s no longer than one whole foot. The construct in its entirety is only tin in durability (scaling naturally through the ranks and capping with Iron at Mage) and seemingly has no real use despite looking pretty. Should it get further than five feet from its caster, or be in physical contact with a mage that isn’t its creator, then the construct will destabilize and spontaneously crumble into small sharp shards and pieces, dissipating entirely from existence in the next rotation. These shards can’t do much damage at first, other than scratching at bare skin about as roughly as fingernails clawing at an itch, but as its durability increases so does its capacity for damage (possible “piercing” power increases, equaling the construct’s durability). Emily can only have one of these roses active at a time, automatically unlocking the ability to make up to two at a time upon reaching Mage rank.
<br><br>
<b>Sparkles the Unicorn</b><br>
A fantastical groundbreaking creation, behold the hobby-horse construct! Sparkles the Unicorn is a pink horned horse-head on a long staff, made entirely out of the caster’s solidified mana. In its entirety the construct is only as durable as tin, with the six inch horn sticking out from the center of its forehead possessing the same capacity for piercing power (scaling up to Iron at Mage rank). Sparkles’ staff is about four feet long, and fits comfortably between its owner’s legs. As unassuming as the toy construct seems it’s actually a decent mode of transportation, capable of holding its caster’s weight and gliding at a steady slow pace  from up to three feet above the ground for one rotation. This aspect scales with the caster’s rank adding an additional rotation to the length of the glide (and therefore slowing its “falling speed”) until she reaches the rank of Mage, when she may indefinitely hover at the cost of a constant mana drain. At the moment it can only zoom around at the calm speed of the average human’s jog, but hey, what other six year old girl can say she has a functioning "witch’s broom" for a unicorn themed hobby horse?
<br><br>
<h1>Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Mana Bubble (Upgrade)</b><br>
A thin shiny construct that has the appearance of liquid but is actually just a slippery solid. It takes the shape of a sphere, designed to form around objects, and appears to float on the air like a typical bubble, but is actually telekinetically controlled by the caster. Can only be occupied by an object of up to equal durability to the construct itself (Steel at Mage as a defensive construct, scaling naturally to Titanium at Expert Mage), but that also means it’s fairly lightweight easy to blow away from the caster. Should the bubble ever reach more than ten feet away from its maker (distance increasing naturally to scale through the ranks, capping at fourteen feet upon reaching Expert Mage) it’ll harmlessly pop into nothingness. Typically this construct has to be able to completely encompass an object for it to work as intended (although nothing is REQUIRED to be inside it for activation and function, although removal of something present from the inside will result in its destruction/deactivation) and since it can only be either as big as a basketball, or have a five foot diameter if charged for a rotation prior to casting, the options are pretty limited.
<br>
Mana Bubble is light and floaty like a soap bubble, meaning that it can easily be knocked about by equal and higher ranking spells meant to push and move objects, assuming they are capable of moving the total weight of whatever’s being stored inside the bubble.
<br>
The only exception to this is the caster’s own body parts, since its base form isn’t near big enough to encompass her entire being she can form it to “engulf” hands, feet, etc with the rest of herself sticking out (When charged for a rotation to reach its max possible dimensions her whole body can fit inside easily). If cast on her body, or around it in its max size, she can still technically manipulate it mentally to achieve a “floating” effect, but is limited to traveling up to five feet above ground (or nearest applicable surface that holds her weight, increasing to up to ten feet at Expert Mage). That being said the oxygen inside is naturally limited, allowing for the possibility of suffocation if used on her head for extended periods of time/too long (limitation of two rotations in its small form, and four rotations in its biggest, before runs out of oxygen).
<br>
Right now she can make up to two small ones at a time. Upon reaching the rank of Expert Mage she will automatically be able to make up to four bubbles (small) at a time. Can only make one big one at a time regardless of how many small ones can be made, but a big one still only counts as one of the total she can possibly make (meaning if she has a big one active she can still make a small one, or any variation of that as she unlocks more possible bubbles through ranking up).
<br><br>
<b>Magus Rose (Upgrade)</b><br>
This construct is seemingly quite innocent, appearing as nothing more than a rather fragile rose, like the glass ones rich people buy from Hallmark shops for some reason. Its stem is no thicker than a pencil, the rose bulb at its end roughly two inches thick, and altogether it’s no longer than one whole foot. The construct in its entirety is only Iron in durability (scaling naturally through the ranks and capping with Cobalt at Expert Mage) and seemingly has no real use despite looking pretty. Should it get further than ten feet from its caster, or be in physical contact with a mage that isn’t its creator and has ill intent harbored specifically toward her (if their ill intent isn’t being hidden by a spell designed to do so of any rank), then the construct will destabilize and spontaneously crumble into small sharp shards and pieces, dissipating entirely from existence in the next rotation. These shards are sharp enough to scrape through Iron grade materials, and can easily pierce/stick into base flesh rather painfully. Emily can only have up to two of these roses active at a time, automatically unlocking the ability to make up to three at a time upon reaching Expert Mage rank. 
<br><br>
<b>Sparkles the Unicorn (Upgrade)</b><br>
A fantastical groundbreaking creation, behold the hobby-horse construct! Sparkles the Unicorn is a pink horned horse-head on a long staff, made entirely out of the caster’s solidified mana. In its entirety the construct is only as durable as Iron, with the six inch horn sticking out from the center of its forehead possessing the same capacity for piercing power (scaling up to Cobalt at Expert Mage rank). Sparkles’ staff is about four feet long, and fits comfortably between its owner’s legs. As unassuming as the toy construct seems it’s actually a decent mode of transportation, capable of holding its caster’s weight and gliding at an even pace from up to six feet above the ground with a constant mana drain. At the moment it can only zoom around at the brisk speed of the average human’s run, but hey, what other six year old girl can say she has a functioning "witch’s broom" for a unicorn themed hobby horse?
<br><br>
<b>Mana Sparkle (Mana Spark Upgrade)</b><br>
A small crackling projectile that sparks in a fashion akin to popular “Fourth of July” stick sparklers, the size of which is equivalent to that of a common softball in total. It is notably formed about six inches away from the caster’s hands (and remains stationary where it is formed unless displaced/knocked away by an external force of at least x2 human strength, or Iron-rendering power, scaling to require x3 strength/Cobalt-rendering power at Expert Mage) since the pretty looking “pops” are actually tiny bead-like constructs in a constant state of chaos. When shot off as a projectile it travels at moderate speeds in a predetermined singular direction (meaning it has to be aimed, can’t just change course or anything) for up to fifteen feet away from the caster. While handling the strange construct while it’s passive would only hurt about as much as an average strength human slapping someone hard in the face, when it actually impacts a solid surface specifically after being shot off as a projectile it possesses a distinct hard impacting force capable of rendering through up to Iron grade materials (scales naturally to Cobalt at Expert Mage), but is immediately spent as soon as it hits any solid surface, even if the durability is low in its possible destruction threshold. Emily can form up to two of these Mana Sparkles at once, the number increasing to four upon reaching the rank of Expert Mage.
<br><br>
<b>Mana Lense (Mana Scouter Upgrade)</b><br>
A construct that manifests as a lense over one of the caster’s eyes, which looks and has the filmy properties of a contact lense, and can be any singular basic color she desires. Has a durability of Iron (scales naturally up to Cobalt at Expert Mage), technically providing a physical protective layer over the soft eyeball, although this is an added minor benefit that doesn’t have much to do with the spell’s actual mechanic. It is actually intended to allow her to see the mana pools of other mages just as the original base Universal does, showing how much is left in their tank/how big the pool is and thus providing the possibility of rank estimation if the user is realistically knowledgeable enough in the situation to do so. The upgraded aspects are that this can now be done through appropriate counter sensory (counter-sensory spells intended to mess with perception of one’s mana pool) less than this spell’s rank (which scales with the caster until capping at Expert Mage until upgraded further). This ability can only be used on mages the lense is actively being used to look at, assuming they’re within twenty feet of the caster, and she is already aware of their presence. Using this spell to observe the pools of those much higher rank than herself (2 ranks above at the very least) will be overwhelming, stunning her into incapacitation for a whole rotation and ailing her with a terribly uncomfortable migraine that will not fade without proper healing.
This construct only lasts for up to three rotations at the most, however, should she manage to keep her eyes locked onto a singular mage being studied by this spell’s ability for one whole rotation (assuming she manages to keep an uninterrupted visual of them during this time), then it will allow one Mana Sparkle to follow them like a heat-seeking missile for as long as it can (Mana Sparkle still limited by its own traveling distance and speed). Only works if a Mana Sparkle is the very next spell cast after this one's activation and/or deactivation.
<br><br>
<h1>Expert Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Mana Bubble (Upgrade)</b><br>
A thin shiny construct that has the appearance of liquid but is actually just a slippery solid. It takes the shape of a sphere, designed to form around objects, and appears to float on the air like a typical bubble, but is actually telekinetically controlled by the caster. Can only be occupied by an object of up to equal durability to the construct itself (Titanium at Expert Mage as a defensive construct, scaling naturally to Tungsten at High Mage), but that also means it’s fairly lightweight and easy to blow away from the caster in its smaller form. Should the bubble ever reach more than twenty feet away from its maker (distance increasing naturally to scale through the ranks, capping at twenty-five feet upon reaching High Mage) it’ll harmlessly pop into nothingness. Typically this construct has to be able to completely encompass an object for it to work as intended (although nothing is REQUIRED to be inside it for activation and function, although removal of something present from the inside will result in its destruction/deactivation) and since it can only be roughly the size of a basketball at its base form what can actually fit inside it is pretty limiting.
<br>
If the caster charges this spell for a rotation prior to casting, OR, has a small Mana Bubble active already, they may increase its small size as they please with the biggest possible measurement being ten feet in diameter.
<br>
Mana Bubble is light and floaty like a soap bubble, meaning that it can easily be knocked about by equal and higher ranking spells meant to push and move objects, assuming they are capable of moving the total weight of whatever’s being stored inside the bubble.
<br>
The only exception to this is the caster’s own body parts, since its base form isn’t near big enough to encompass her entire being she can form it to “engulf” hands, feet, etc with the rest of herself sticking out (When charged for a rotation to reach its max possible dimensions her whole body can fit inside easily). If cast on her body, or around it in its max size, she can still technically manipulate it mentally to achieve a “floating” effect, but is limited to traveling up to ten feet above ground (or nearest applicable surface that holds her weight, increasing to up to fifteen feet at High Mage). That being said the oxygen inside is naturally limited, allowing for the possibility of suffocation if used on her head for extended periods of time/too long (limitation of two rotations in its small form, and six rotations in its biggest, before runs out of oxygen). Upon reaching the rank of High Mage she will automatically gain the ability to fill the bubble’s surface with tiny needle-sized holes (if she desires), allowing the flow of oxygen but also risking the possibility of toxins in the air leaking through.
<br>
Right now she can make up to four small ones at a time. Upon reaching the rank of High Mage she will automatically be able to make up to six bubbles (small) at a time. Can only make one big one at a time regardless of how many small ones can be made, but a big one still only counts as one of the total she can possibly make (meaning if she has a big one active she can still make a small one, or any variation of that as she unlocks more possible bubbles through ranking up).
<br><br>
<b>Sparkles the Unicorn (Upgrade)</b><br>
Emily’s capacity for making more intricate constructs increased and mixed with the strong desire to own a pony or a unicorn found in any little girl, resulting in an impressive upgrade for Sparkles the Unicorn. Instead of just a horse head on a stick, Sparkles is now a full fledged Unicorn shaped pink translucent construct! The construct itself is six feet tall (from the top of its ears to its hooves), and another six feet long (from its nose to its rear), fairly close in size to the average real life pony. It also has a one foot long sharp horn extending straight out from its forehead. The construct in its entirety is Cobalt in durability (scaling to Titanium at High Mage) and has an equal piercing power at the sharp end of its horn, but it also weighs a whopping 200 lbs! Because it is heavy momentum is a plausible issue, causing it to come to a full stop slower the faster it moves, additionally making turns--especially sharp or sudden ones--is much harder.
<br>
Sparkles is for all intents and purposes a mount, which can respond to basic commands from its maker (like fly there, run, charge, attack, etc) but possesses no capacity for higher thinking or sentience that is any higher than bare minimum basics, as it is a construct and not a real creature. Its maximum movement speed on the ground is double that of the average human’s (x2), which increases to triple (x3) specifically when in flight. Sparkles can only fly up to twenty feet above the ground (or nearest applicable surface that can hold its weight), and the act of flying costs Emily additional mana. The Unicorn construct has no rotation duration and can be created and kept active in exchange for a continuous mana drain (flight increases its mana cost greatly) and remain active around her person indefinitely assuming it isn’t destroyed, doesn’t get further than thirty feet from her at any time, and she still has enough in the Mana Pool to continue devoting to it. Of course she can always choose to deactivate it whenever the need arises.
<br><br>
<b>Mana Sparkle (Upgrade)</b><br>
A small crackling projectile that sparks in a fashion akin to popular “Fourth of July” stick sparklers, the size of which is equivalent to that of a common softball in total. It is notably formed about six inches away from the caster’s hands (and remains stationary where it is formed unless displaced/knocked away by an external force of at least x3 human strength, or Cobalt-rendering power, scaling to require x4 strength/Titanium-rendering power at High Mage) the pretty looking “pops” are actually tiny bead-like balls of pure destructive Arcane Energy in a constant state of chaos. When shot off as a projectile it travels at moderately fast speeds in a predetermined singular direction for up to twenty five feet away from the caster, but can be knocked off course by other spells equal to its rank (scaling to High Mage as well) and forced into premature detonation. Stationary Sparkles that have yet to be launched as projectiles can also be contested this way, but instead of exploding they just fizzle out. An additional benefit, thanks to this particular upgrade, is that as long as the Mana Sparkles remain within twenty feet of the caster (and within her line of sight) she may telepathically adjust their trajectory to a new target. 
<br>
While passive--before being launched as a projectile--they can eat/melt through Steel grade constructs (or equivalent, scaling to Cobalt at High Mage, objects lesser durability/rank can be burned through with little to no reduction in momentum) without being spent but only for up to two rotations; when they actually impact a solid surface specifically after being shot off as a projectile they possess a distinct hard impacting force, scattering their destructive energy about in a small five foot radius explosion, capable of rendering through up to Cobalt grade materials (scales naturally to Titanium at High Mage), and is no longer immediately spent as soon as it hits any solid surface like its previous iteration. After its explosion the energy can continue to stay for a single post, but only eat through Steel durability at the most during this time (scales to Cobalt at High Mage). If they impact a lesser ranked surface she can still choose to set them off (assuming again they are within the distance limitation and her line of sight) with an extra mana cost. Emily can form up to four of these Mana Sparkles at once, the number increasing to six upon reaching the rank of High Mage.

<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Bush Bowser</b><br>
Emily creates a small construct comprised entirely out of rose bushes in the shape of a leafy puppy. Being made out of plants it only weighs roughly ten pounds, and is roughly the size of your average household pup (twoish feet tall). The Bush Bowser is essentially a “puppet” that can respond to mental commands from its maker and perform basic actions applicable to puppies (run, swipe, bite, etc) with much less finesse and fluidity in its movements. As a whole the construct is only Tin in durability (scaling naturally to Iron at Mage), and has thorns from the roses it’s made of on its “paws” and in its “mouth” to act as pseudo claws and teeth. These thorns are also only strong enough to damage things up to Tin in durability (scaling to Iron at Mage). At Paige only one of these hounds can be made at a time, but upon reaching the rank of Mage she automatically unlocks the capacity to make up to two. They last for three rotations and can only continue to exist within a ten foot radius of the caster. (Base human stats for things like movement speed) Pyromancy of Bush Bowser’s rank (or above) will ignite the entire plant regardless of where fire actually made contact on its body, destroying it completely unless the flame is doused in time. Additionally extended contact with Aquamancy (or base mundane water) will slow their movement speed. If continually in contact with a moderate water source for two rotations movement will be dropped to 1/2 that of the average human’s capacity, and remained that way unless destroyed or effectively dried.
<br><br>
<b>Ouchie Flower</b><br>
The caster can choose any single spot within a ten foot radius of herself (has to be actively looking at the spot desired, meaning by extension it must be within her line of sight) to grow a singular rose. Once grown additional mana can be sacrificed toward the flower in order to extend two thorny tendrils as offshoots from its stem. Should any being (that Emily can actually detect) enter a five foot radius of the rose, the aforementioned tendrils will immediately attempt to snap around their nearest limbs and entangle them in a thorny mess. Flower’s stem, tendrils, and thorns, are only as durable as Tin (scaling to Iron at Mage). This spell takes one rotation of charge time (has to grow the flower for the charge time, tendrils can be grown and considered active in the next rotation). Plain nonmagic roses without the tendrils can be grown and left indefinitely, but as soon as the thorny vine aspect is created/activated the spell only remains active for three rotations before it wilts away into nothingness. They will also wilt away into nothingness if they ever leave a ten foot vicinity of their maker; this applies to the tendril mode, since plain roses grown can be left behind as just plain roses. Growing the roses at any stage is limited to soil that is in direct physical contact with the caster.
<br><br>
<b>Perfume of Niceness</b><br>
In the palms of cupped hands Emily may create a pile of rose petals all coated in spores that have a very specific effect. She can either toss the petals into the air, or blow them at a target in close proximity (the furthest away she can send this spell is fifteen feet). After getting the magic plant matter into the air it stays put for three rotations, creating a five foot radius (visible) zone. Any individual who is in this zone, or steps through it, will experience the effects, assuming that the petals either make direct contact with skin (or flesh equivalent) or the air in that zone is actively breathed in. That’s all great, but what does it actually do? Perfume of Niceness is effectively a very minor sedative intended to induce a state of calm on creatures of Emily’s rank (or less, scaling to Mage), and help soothe frayed nerves as well as slightly dampen hostility in fellow mages and higher ranked beasts.
This is only effective on magically-made creatures created by Emily, all other creatures that are results of spells will experience nothing. It is also extremely susceptible to being completely blown away by Aeromancy and “push” forces above the spell’s rank (scaling to Mage).
<li>Only works on basic bestiary creatures, owners of certain creatures on the page can also decide if/when this spell actually affects them, but they should have a good reason for it not to if they decline.</li>
